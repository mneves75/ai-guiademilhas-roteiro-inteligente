Next.js 16 represents a major milestone in the React ecosystem. Here's why we chose it as the foundation for this boilerplate.

## React 19 Integration

Next.js 16 ships with React 19, bringing powerful new features:

### Server Components

Server Components are the default in the App Router, enabling:

- **Reduced client bundle size** - Server-only code never ships to the browser
- **Direct database access** - Query your database from components
- **Improved security** - Sensitive logic stays on the server

```tsx
// This component runs entirely on the server
async function UserList() {
  const users = await db.query.users.findMany();

  return (
    <ul>
      {users.map((user) => (
        <li key={user.id}>{user.name}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

### Server Actions

Form handling becomes trivial with Server Actions:

```tsx
async function createUser(formData: FormData) {
  'use server';

  const name = formData.get('name');
  await db.insert(users).values({ name });
}
```

## Performance Improvements

Next.js 16 includes significant performance optimizations:

- **Turbopack** - Lightning-fast development builds
- **Partial Prerendering** - Combine static and dynamic content
- **Streaming** - Progressive rendering with Suspense

## Developer Experience

The developer experience in Next.js 16 is exceptional:

- **TypeScript First** - Full type safety out of the box
- **File-based Routing** - Intuitive page organization
- **Built-in Optimizations** - Images, fonts, and scripts

## Why Not Other Frameworks?

We evaluated several alternatives:

| Framework | Pros              | Cons                  |
| --------- | ----------------- | --------------------- |
| Remix     | Great forms       | Smaller ecosystem     |
| Astro     | Fast static sites | Limited interactivity |
| SvelteKit | Great DX          | Different paradigm    |

Next.js struck the best balance of features, ecosystem, and stability.

## Conclusion

Next.js 16 provides the perfect foundation for building modern, production-ready applications. Combined with our carefully selected stack, you get:

- Type-safe database queries with Drizzle
- Beautiful UI with shadcn/ui
- Secure authentication with Better Auth
- Seamless payments with Stripe
